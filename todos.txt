try not to flood the exchange with many orders at once

check the results of each trade, and make the program stop trading if any irregularities have occurred

check what happens if the program crashes. make sure the program can be stopped/crashed and resumed at any time without detriment.

make sure the program knows how to behave if it runs out of available usdt (does it simply wait till it becomes available?)

add a scenario where you take some of the generated profit, from the usdt pool, for example, monthly

create topUpBot.js file to add cryptocurrency to the bot
