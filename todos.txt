check the results of each trade, and make the programstop trading if any irregularities have occurred

if the % gain from trading is < exchange fee, then ask the user to reconfigure bot options

add a scenario where you take some of the generated profit, from the usdt pool, for example, monthly

save the hands array to a file, and create backups

save a log file with all trades

test various historical scenarios, with different date ranges, bear markets, etc

test many automatically generated scenarios and see which generates most profit

test more than one bot per account running at once

allot different sums of usdt to different hands

check what happens if the program crashes. make sure the program can be stopped/crashed and resumed at any time without detriment.

make sure the program knows how to behave if it runs out of available usdt (does it simply wait till it becomes available?)

add total exchange fees paid to the summary report
